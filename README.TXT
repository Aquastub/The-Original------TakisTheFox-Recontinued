Hi this is luigi budd lmaoooo

If youre datamining to simply analyize how Takis works, thats fine by me!
If youre datamining to add support for your custom whatever, thats fine!
If youre datamining to remove the maps and SOC, thats fine by me!
Just please don't remove anything else!

But if youre datamining to use my assets or code, PLEASE DONT! Ask me FIRST
before using my assets!
There are SOME exceptions to this, any code from reusable addons or Kart, DRRR, or SRB2's source
are fine to copy (theyre open source and gpl after all), as well as all music
and assets from sources not owned by me. (Antonblast, Pizza Tower, TF2)

Aseprite files on the assets github are free to use, just credit me if you use them!
